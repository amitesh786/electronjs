# electronjs
Creating desktop applications using javascript, css, html etc.
I have created 3 folders - Renderer, BrowserWindow, Widget
Renderer - you can verify how to open a browser one by one + one inside one.
BrowserWindow - you can verify how to open parent inside child + how it will work + how to add colors.
Widget - in this case it wil take data from api and upload content in the desktop application.
